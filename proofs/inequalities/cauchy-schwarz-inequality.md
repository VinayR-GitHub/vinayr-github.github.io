## The Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality
The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality is one of the most well-known and universal theorems in the history of olympiad mathematics. In its most general form, it describes the nature of arbitrary vector spaces equipped with an inner product. In this post, I will prove the case over \( \mathbb{R} \).

## The Statement
Given two sequences...

## The Proof
Let there exist vectors...
