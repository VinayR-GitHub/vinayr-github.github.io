## The Inscribed Angle Theorem
The inscribed angle theorem is one of the simplest and most universal results in the theory of circles in Euclidean spaces. It states in simplest form that the angle subtended by an arc from a point on a circle is half that of the angle subtended by the same arc from the circle's centre.

## Statement
Let $ \omega $ be a circle in Euclidean space, with centre $ O $. Let there be 2 distinct points $ A , B \in \omega $, with a point $ C \in \widehat{AB} $, where $ \widehat{AB} $ is a major arc. It holds that:
$$ \angle AOB = 2 \angle ACB $$

## Proof
Construct a line segment $ \overline{OC} $. As $ |\overline{OA}| = |\overline{OB}| = |\overline{OC}| = r $, it follows that $ \Delta OCA $ and $ \Delta OCB $ are isosceles. Let $ \phi_1 = \angle COA , \phi_2 = \angle COB , \theta_1 = \angle OCA , \theta_2 = \angle OCB $. Additionally, let $ \varphi_A = \angle ACB , \varphi_O = \angle AOB $. It follows that:
$$ \phi_1 + 2 \theta_1 = \pi $$
$$ \phi_2 + 2 \theta_2 = \pi $$
$$ \phi_1 + \phi_2 + 2 (\theta_1 + \theta_2) = 2 \pi $$
$$ \phi_1 + \phi_2 + 2 \varphi_A = 2 \pi $$
$$ \varphi_O = 2 \pi - \phi_1 - \phi_2 $$
The theorem follows trivially:
$$ \therefore \angle AOB = 2 \angle ACB $$
